🧠 Cross-Language Feedback Analysis using NLP

🌍 Overview
Customer feedback often comes in multiple languages, making it hard for companies to understand global sentiments.
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze feedback written in any language, automatically detect and translate it to English, and perform sentiment analysis to classify opinions as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

Built with:
🐍 Python
🤖 Transformers & NLP (Hugging Face, TextBlob)
🌐 Streamlit for interactive web UI
☁️ Google Colab for training and experimentation

🚀 Features

✅ Automatic Language Detection — detects any input language using langdetect.
✅ Translation to English — uses deep-translator for accurate translation.
✅ Sentiment Analysis — classifies text using pretrained NLP models.
✅ Bulk Feedback Upload — analyze multiple comments at once (CSV upload).
✅ Streamlit Dashboard — clean UI for user interaction and visualization.
✅ Deployable on Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces.

How It Works
Step	Description
1️⃣	User enters feedback (or uploads CSV)
2️⃣	Language detected using langdetect
3️⃣	Text translated to English
4️⃣	Sentiment analyzed using TextBlob / Transformer
5️⃣	Results displayed with overall summary


💬 Future Enhancements
