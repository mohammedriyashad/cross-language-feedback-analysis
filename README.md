Cross-Language Feedback Analysis using NLP

Project Overview:
This project provides an automated system to analyze customer feedback in multiple languages using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Users can input feedback in different languages, and the system will process it to extract insights, sentiment, and key themes. The application also supports bulk feedback analysis, making it suitable for businesses dealing with large volumes of customer responses.
The frontend is built with Streamlit, allowing easy web deployment and user interaction.

Features
-Accepts feedback in multiple languages.
-Sentiment analysis to classify feedback as positive, negative, or neutral.
-Keyword and theme extraction from user feedback.
-Bulk feedback analysis by uploading CSV files.
-Interactive Streamlit dashboard for visualization and real-time results.


Tech Stack
-Backend / NLP: Python, spaCy, NLTK, TextBlob, Transformers (optional)
-Frontend: Streamlit
-Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
-Deployment: Streamlit Cloud / Hugging Face
